Fourscore and seven years ago, out  fathers brought forth upon this continent a new Nation, conceived in Liberty,
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are cread equal , Now, we are engaged in a great Civil War, testing
whether that Nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure , We are met on  a great
battlefield of that war , We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting -place for those who 
here gave their lives that that Nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this 

But, in larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot conserate , we cannot, hallow this ground, The brave men 
living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above out  pooor power to add or detract, The world will 
little nore nor long remeber what we say here , but it can never forget what they did here It is for us , the living rather to be
dedicated here to the unfinished work  which they who fought here have thus  far so nobly  
abvanced It is rather for us to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we  here  highly resolve that these dead shall not 
have died in vain, that this Nation, under GOD, shall have a new birth of  freedom and  the government of People and for the people shall not perish from the earth
